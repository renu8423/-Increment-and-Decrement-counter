 # Code Description
This application is built using React and consists of a simple Counter component with the following key functionality:

* useState is used to manage the count state, which holds the current counter value.
* The addvalue function increments the count by 1, ensuring it doesn't exceed the maximum limit of 20.
* The removevalue function decrements the count by 1, ensuring it doesn't go below the minimum limit of 0.
* The buttons trigger the addvalue and removevalue functions to update the counter.

# Components:
